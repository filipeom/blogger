Welcome! My name is Filipe Marques. I am a PhD Student in <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/phd-home">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a>, enrolled through the CMU Portugal Affiliated PhD Program. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors <a href="https://web.ist.utl.pt/jose.fragoso">José Fragoso Santos</a>, <a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~nsantos">Nuno Santos</a>, and <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/jia-limin.html">Limin Jia</a>.

I am also a junior researcher at <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt">INESC ID</a>. My research focuses on programming languages, formal methods, and automated test generation, with a particular interest in making software systems more secure and reliable.

I'm an open-source enthusiast, a strong advocate for well-typed code, and an unapologetic fan of <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. I believe programming languages should help you reason, not just compile.
