Welcome! My name is Filipe Marques. I am a PhD Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), under the CMU Portugal Affiliated PhD Program, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. José Fragoso Santos and Prof. Nuno Santos. I am also a junior researcher at INESC-ID. My research interests are focused on programming languages, software verification and validation, formal methods, and cybersecurity.

Previously, I completed my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at IST. My dissertation, entitled Robust Symbolic Execution for WebAssembly, was supervised by Prof. José Fragoso Santos and Prof. Nuno Santos and was defended on December 2021.
